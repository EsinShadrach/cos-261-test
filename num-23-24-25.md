# Documentation and Comments in Java

### 23. Why Should Java Developers Write Comments in Their Code?

Comments enhance code clarity by explaining *why* certain decisions were made or how specific parts of the code work.

- Improve code readability and maintainability.
- Assist other developers in understanding complex logic.
- Make onboarding easier for new team members.

### 24. What Are JavaDoc Comments and How Are They Different?

JavaDoc comments use `/** ... */` and support tags like `@param`, `@return`, and `@author`.

| Type         | Syntax            | Purpose                        |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Single-line  | // comment        | Quick, in-line notes           |
| Multi-line   | /* comment */     | Larger blocks or explanations  |
| JavaDoc      | /** comment */    | Structured API documentation   |

```java
/**
 * Calculates the average of five integers.
 *
 * @param a the first number
 * @param b the second number
 * @param c the third number
 * @param d the fourth number
 * @param e the fifth number
 * @return the average of the five numbers
 */
public static double average(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e) {
    return (a + b + c + d + e) / 5.0;
}
```
