### **14. What does it mean to write ‚Äúclean code‚Äù?**

Clean code is simple, clear, and easy to follow. Anyone reading it (including you six months later) should understand what‚Äôs going on easily

#### üîß 3 ways to keep your code clean:

1. **Use meaningful names** ‚Äî `calculateTotal()` is better than `calc()`.
2. **Break things up** ‚Äî avoid giant methods; let each method do one thing.
3. **Keep formatting consistent** ‚Äî use indentation and spacing.

### **15. Why avoid long methods?**

Long methods are messy, confusing, and hard to follow. Smaller methods:

- Are easier to test
- Help you spot bugs faster
- Make your code more reusable

### **16. Java Naming Conventions (with examples)**

Java has some naming conventions that help make code readable:

| What      | Convention | Example            |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Classes   | PascalCase | `StudentProfile`   |
| Variables | camelCase  | `studentName`      |
| Methods   | camelCase  | `calculateScore()` |

```java
public class StudentProfile {
    String studentName;

    public void calculateScore() {
        System.out.println("Score calculated.");
    }
}
```

### 17. Importance of Breaking Java Programs into Methods

- Improves readability and reusability.
- Simplifies debugging and testing.
- Encourages logical separation of concerns, making your code easier to understand and modify.

Instead of writing everything in main(), extract logic into meaningful methods.

### 18 Explain DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)

DRY is a principle that encourages reducing repetition in code by abstracting duplicated logic.

```java
public class Greeting {
    public static void greet(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greet("Rafe");
        greet("Ada");
        greet("Zainab");
    }
}
```

### 19. Benefits of Using Classes and Objects

- Encapsulation: Group related data and methods together.
- Reusability: Objects can be reused and shared across parts of the program.
- Modularity: Easier to manage and debug parts of your program.
- Scalability: Object-oriented design scales better for large applications than monolithic main() methods.
