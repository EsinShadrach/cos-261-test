### **20. Why is Testing Important During Program Development?**

Testing plays a critical role in the software development process. It helps to ensure that a program behaves as expected under various conditions and meets its specified requirements.

#### Key reasons testing is essential:

- **Error Detection**: Identifies bugs early before they reach production.
- **Confidence**: Verifies that code changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Quality Assurance**: Improves the reliability, performance, and user satisfaction of the application.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitates future updates by providing a safety net through regression testing.

In summary, testing is not optional; it is a best practice that contributes to robust, maintainable, and trustworthy software.

### **21. Difference Between Syntax Error, Runtime Error, and Logic Error**

- **Syntax errors** are caught at compile-time.
- **Runtime errors** are only detected when the program is running.
- **Logic errors** are the most subtle and must be identified through testing and debugging.

### **22. How to Test a Method That Calculates the Average of Five Numbers**

To test a method that calculates the average of five integers, you should consider a range of test cases that validate both normal and edge scenarios.

#### Example Method:

```java
public class AverageCalculator {
    public static double average(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e) {
        return (a + b + c + d + e) / 5.0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Average: " + average(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)); // Expected: 30.0
    }
}
```

- Standard input: average(10, 20, 30, 40, 50) → 30.0
- All zeros: average(0, 0, 0, 0, 0) → 0.0
- Negative numbers: average(-5, -10, -15, -20, -25) → -15.0
- Mixed positive and negative: average(-10, 0, 10, 20, 30) → 10.0
- Large values: Ensure it handles Integer.MAX_VALUE and doesn’t overflow.
